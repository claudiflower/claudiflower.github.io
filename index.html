                    Managing Team & Teacher: I taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to high school girls in the area, 
                    creating the 9-week curriculum from scratch. I’ve taught every semester since, 
                    and it’s definitely still one of my favorite commitments, seeing my girls grow and make 
                    their own websites!

                    Over winter break, I worked on a project through Barnard Connect to 
                    design a website for a new virtual product. I identified weak points 
                    in the old design, and after many iterations and interviews, completed a 
                    final Figma design.

                    I began research for my professor, funded by the NIST, in which I create 
                    mods for the game, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes using C# and Unity. 
                    The research is related to first responders’ performances with audio discrepancies 
                    in walkie talkie devices. Still ongoing!
